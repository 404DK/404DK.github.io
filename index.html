<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is DudiI and I was born in Cairo, Egypt. I moved to
America at 2 years old and lived in Utica, NY. I attended Thomas R. Proctor High school and
my favorite hobbies are reading, playing video games, and playing basketball. I decided to 
attend RIT because of the scholarship, and co-op program.

<p> My favorite food is: </p>
